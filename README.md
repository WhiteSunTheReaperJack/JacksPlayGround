Issues encountered:
GA: I put Github link in the container when setting up my GA to track down the website, which did not make a sense to me cuz Github link wasn`t the actual website I visited. However GA updated visitors to the website just fine. 
Solution: Figured out the link for the container wasn`t the key to track down. It was nothing but a ref. The code given when setting up GA had unique ID # sending GA.
